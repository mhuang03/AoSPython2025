# Problem 1: FizzBuzz
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints:
# - "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
# - "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
# - "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
# - The number itself if it is neither divisible by 3 nor 5.
# For example, if the user enters 15, the program should print "FizzBuzz".
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%).



# Problem 2: Quadratic Formula
# Ask the user for the coefficients a,b,c of a quadratic in ax^2+bx+c=0 form.
# Then, compute the real roots of the equation and print them out.
# If you don't know the quadratic formula, either Google it or skip this one for now.
# Hint: use the discriminant to determine whether solutions are real.
import math
math.sqrt(9)  # == 3, square root function



# Problem 3: Factorial
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then calculates the factorial of that number.
# The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
# For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
# Hint: Use a loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to n together.



# Problem 4: Fibonacci
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers.
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
# For example, the first 5 Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.
# Hint: Use some variables to keep track of the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers.



# Problem 5: Smart Guesser
# In class, we wrote a program for a higher/lower guessing game.
# Create a program that implements a guessing strategy for the computer, where the user tells
# the program higher/lower instead. What kind of strategy can the computer use?
# Hint: If the user isn't lying, the optimal strategy for guessing 1-100 guarantees the
# correct answer in at most 7 tries.
