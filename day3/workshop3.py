# Problem 1: Word Count
# Write a program that asks the user for some words, then prints each unique word and
# how many times it appeared.
# Hint: Use a dictionary to store the counts of each word.



# Problem 2: Isogram
# Design a function that accepts a string and returns True if the string is an isogram,
# and False otherwise. An isogram is a word or phrase without any repeating letters.
# For example, "hello" is not an isogram, but "world" is.
# Hint: Use a set to store the letters in the string and check for duplicates.



# Problem 3: Anagrams
# Design a function that accepts two strings and returns True if the strings are anagrams,
# and False otherwise. Anagrams are words or phrases that are formed by rearranging the
# letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
# For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
# Hint: You could: 1) use a dictionary to store the counts of each letter in each string.
#               or 2) sort the letters in each string and compare the sorted strings.



# Problem 4: Collinear Points
# Design a function that accepts a list of n tuples, each representing the coordinates
# of a point in 2D space, and returns True if all the points are collinear, and False otherwise.
# Two or more points are collinear if they all lie on the same straight line.
# Hint: Use the slope formula to calculate the slope of the line between points.
